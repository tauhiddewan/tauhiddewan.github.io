Hello, I'm **Dewan Tauhid Rahman**, a passionate researcher and technologist with a focus on cutting-edge fields such as Computer Vision, Robotics, IoT, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My keen interest lies in leveraging these technologies to address and solve real-world problems. I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Under the guidance of Prof. Dr. [Md. Shamim Anower](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/Professor%20Dr.%20Md.%20Shamim%20Anower "Academic profile"), I have translated my research interests into tangible contributions. Notably, my thesis work in Computer Vision has been adapted into a journal article, currently awaiting review.

## Research Interest
- Computer Vision.
- Natural Language Processing.
- Reinforcement Learning.
- Robotics.
- Internet of Things (IoT).
